# ABSTRACT
Thesis on the topic "System of classification of computed tomography images of healthy lungs and patients with COVID-19" was completed by Marko Shkepast, a student of the Department of Biomedical Cybernetics at the Faculty of Computer Science and Cybernetics. The thesis was carried out within the educational-professional program "Computer Technologies in Biology and Medicine" under the specialization 122 "Computer Science." It consists of an introduction, three chapters (literature review, theoretical part, practical part), conclusions for each of these chapters, general conclusions, a list of references comprising 31 sources, and appendices. The total volume of the thesis is 71 pages.

# The relevance. 
The topic "Classification system of computed tomography images of healthy lungs and patients with COVID-19" continues to be extremely relevant and important in the context of medical research. COVID-19, a viral disease that disrupts the function of the respiratory system, can lead to serious complications and death. Given this, the development of an accurate and efficient classification system for computed tomography images is an extremely important task for the medical community.

# The purpose and tasks of the work. 
The aim of this work is to implement a neural network to solve the complex task of classifying computed tomography images in order to facilitate the process of diagnosing COVID-19. As COVID-19 is a serious lung disease, its early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for successful treatment and control of the disease spread.

# Achieving it involves solving the following tasks: 
1.	Analysis of domestic and foreign sources.
2.	Structuring the input data
3.	Creating a convolutional neural network architecture
4.	Training the network and analysing the results
5.	Developing a graphical user interface

# Used methods.
Python programming language, Jupyter Notebook development environment. The framework for creating neural networks is TensorFlow. Also, the libraries NumPy, Matplotlib, Skleran, os, and shutil were used in the work. The graphical user interface was developed using the PyQt5 framework.

# Results. 
Application for classification of computed tomography images of healthy lungs and patients with COVID-19 based on convolutional neural network.

# Keywords. 
COVID-19, computed tomography, neural network, classification, convolutional neural network, image processing.
